//! Fine-grained linter checks that emit [`PolicyViolation`] with per-line
//! source locations.
//!
//! These checks complement the existing [`crate::rules::PolicyRule`] trait
//! checks, providing more precise diagnostics (file + line number) and the
//! richer [`PolicyViolation`] type.
//!
//! # Available checks
//!
//! | Module | Check | Rule ID |
//! |--------|-------|---------|
//! | [`banned_imports`] | `use rand::` / `use ndarray::` in non-core crates | `SOURCE_SCAN_001/002` |
//! | [`banned_deps`] | Banned crates in `Cargo.toml` | `BANNED_DEP_001` |
//! | [`unwrap_check`] | `.unwrap()` outside `#[cfg(test)]` blocks | `UNWRAP_001` |
//! | [`semver_check`] | Deprecation policy enforcement | `DEPRECATION_001..004` |
//! | [`api_compat`] | Public API surface compatibility | `API_COMPAT_001..003` |
