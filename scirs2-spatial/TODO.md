- Spatial statistics: Moran's I, Geary's C, Ripley's K, G function

### Spatial Join Operations
- Point-in-polygon join
- Distance-based join (all pairs within threshold)
- Nearest-neighbor join between two datasets

### Trajectory Analysis
- Ramer-Douglas-Peucker simplification
- Frechet distance
- Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
- Speed, acceleration, curvature computation

### Point Cloud Processing

- Procrustes analysis (orthogonal and extended)

### Spatial Interpolation
- Simple Kriging and Ordinary Kriging with variogram fitting
- Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)
- Radial Basis Functions (RBF) with multiple kernel choices
- Natural neighbor interpolation (Sibson)
- Shepard's method (generalized IDW)

### Geometric Algorithms
- Sweep line for line segment intersection (Bentley-Ottmann)
- Trapezoidal map for point location
- Arrangement computation (planar subdivisions)
- Ramer-Douglas-Peucker and Visvalingam-Whyatt simplification

### Collision Detection
- Circle vs circle, sphere vs sphere, AABB vs AABB, OBB vs OBB
- Continuous collision detection for moving objects
- BVH broad-phase with SAT narrow-phase

## v0.4.0 Roadmap

### GPU-Accelerated Spatial Indexing
- GPU-based KD-Tree construction and traversal
- GPU batch nearest-neighbor queries (millions of queries per second)
- GPU distance matrix computation via OxiBLAS
- CUDA/Metal backend selection through scirs2-core GPU abstractions

### Real-Time Streaming Spatial Queries
- Incremental insertion and deletion in KD-Tree and R*-Tree (kinetic data structures)
- Sliding window spatial queries for streaming point clouds
- Online Voronoi diagram updates with vertex event processing
- Pub/sub interface for spatial change notifications

### Advanced Spatial Statistics
- Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA)
- Kernel density estimation (KDE) with spatial bandwidth selection
- Spatial regression models (spatial lag, spatial error)
- Spatial scan statistics for cluster detection

### Large-Scale Geospatial Processing
- Efficient handling of billion-point datasets via chunked R*-Tree
- Hilbert curve spatial sorting for cache-efficient access
- GeoParquet and GeoArrow format support (via scirs2-io)

## Known Issues

- Voronoi construction for >100K seed points may be slow; use grid-based approximation for large inputs
- Ball Tree does not yet support user-defined distance functions with non-Euclidean metrics in all cases
- R*-Tree deletion is not yet implemented (insert-only for now)
- Kriging variogram fitting may diverge without good initial parameter estimates for poorly sampled data
