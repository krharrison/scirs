## Known Issues

- Bilateral filter performance degrades significantly for large kernel sizes (>21x21); use a fast approximation for large kernels
- 3D watershed can be memory-intensive for large volumes; use chunked processing via the `chunked` module
- Chan-Vese segmentation convergence depends strongly on the `mu`, `lambda1`, `lambda2` parameters; automatic initialization is not yet implemented
- SLIC superpixels in 3D may not maintain exactly the requested number of superpixels due to boundary effects
- Atlas-based segmentation requires pre-registered atlas; no built-in registration is performed
