## Known Issues

- Slice sampling performance degrades on very high-dimensional posteriors (>100 dimensions) — use HMC/NUTS instead
- Deep GP fitting is memory-intensive for large datasets (>10k points); sparse approximation recommended
- TVP-VAR with large lag orders (>4) and many series (>8) may be slow without parallel feature enabled
